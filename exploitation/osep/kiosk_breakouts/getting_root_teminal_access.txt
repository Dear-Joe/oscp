#Inspection of the /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/10-xorg.conf configuration file reveals that "DontVTSwitch" is uncommented, 
#which means VT switching is disabled. 
#VT switching refers to the ability to switch dynamically between virtual terminal2:1 interfaces.

#Once we have VT switching enabled, we need to define a TTY for the system in the /etc/inittab file.

#we openm /home/guest/inittab.txt with Scratchpad
#We'll add a TTY by adding the following line to the "Standard console login" section under the two commented lines

c3::respawn:/sbin/agetty --noclear --autologin root 38400 tty3 linux

#We save the file and copy it back to /etc/inittab

#At this point, if we were physically located at the kiosk, we could use xdotool key Ctrl+Alt+F3 to switch to a TTY terminal session. 
#However, because we are accessing the kiosk through VNC, we must perform a few extra steps. Using Scratchpad, 
#we can create  getmeatty.sh script containing the following code

#!/bin/bash
killall x11vnc 
x11vnc -rawfb vt3

#And run the script

chmod +x getmeatty.sh
